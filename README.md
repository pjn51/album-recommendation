# Adjective Assisted Album Aggregation
This is the repository for my music recommendation app.

For my blog about the app, see my [medium]() article.

In order to run this app, you'll have to run the `get_albums()` function, save the resulting DataFrame to your computer, and then enter `streamlit run album_recc.py` in your command line. A window should open in your default browser allowing you to access the Adjective Assited Album Aggregator.
